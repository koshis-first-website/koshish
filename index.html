            <h2>My Full Coding Journey 🚀</h2>
            
            <p>At first, I was in my mama's house, and I saw my brother typing something like &lt;body&gt;. I asked him about it, and he told me I wouldn't understand. After that, I was really curious, so I searched online and found out it was **coding**! At first, I didn't understand anything. I took help from ChatGPT to learn the basics, and that's when I started doing coding.</p>
            
            <p>I began with **HTML**, and I created my first simple webpage that only contained information like "Hello, this is my first website." After that, I learned about **CSS** and **JavaScript**. I created many mini-games on my mobile phone, which was a huge achievement for me!</p>
            
            <p>After some days, I decided to create this webpage. I learned how to animate a webpage by seeing my brother's computer—he has his own animated page. After I went home, I tried many times to create my own animated webpage, and finally, I made this one! This was my journey of coding.</p>
